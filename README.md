## WebGL Viewer

The result of my foray in to browser-based 3D graphics programming - with JavaScript and WebGL (OpenGL for browsers!). I didn't know what exactly to start with so I wrote an `.obj` file importer and renderer.

You can view a live demo of the project **[here](https://geoorgeous.github.io/webgl_viewer/)**.

I learnt a lot from this project so I'm finished, for now. A lot of the UI controls don't work so I might come back and fix them.
